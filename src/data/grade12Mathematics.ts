      correct: "k > 2 or k < -2",
      explanation: "For two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be positive: Δ = k² - 4(1)(1) = k² - 4 > 0, so k² > 4, which gives k > 2 or k < -2.",

      question: "If α and β are roots of x² - px + q = 0, what is the equation whose roots are α² and β²?",
      options: ["x² - (p² - 2q)x + q² = 0", "x² - p²x + q² = 0", "x² + (p² - 2q)x + q² = 0", "x² - (p² + 2q)x + q² = 0"],
      correct: "x² - (p² - 2q)x + q² = 0",
      explanation: "From Vieta's formulas: α + β = p, αβ = q. We need α² + β² = (α + β)² - 2αβ = p² - 2q and α²β² = (αβ)² = q². So the equation is x² - (p² - 2q)x + q² = 0.",

      options: ["1", "2", "4", "0"],
      correct: "2",
      explanation: "Let f(x) = (x - 1)² + (x - 3)² = x² - 2x + 1 + x² - 6x + 9 = 2x² - 8x + 10. The minimum occurs at x = 8/4 = 2. f(2) = 2(4) - 16 + 10 = 2.",

      options: ["1", "2", "3", "0"],
      correct: "2",
      explanation: "From the conditions: a + b + c = 0, 4a + 2b + c = 3, 9a + 3b + c = 8. Subtracting first from second: 3a + b = 3. Subtracting second from third: 5a + b = 5. So 2a = 2, thus a = 1. Then b = 0 and c = -1. Therefore f(0) = c = -1. Wait, let me recheck: if a = 1, b = 0, c = -1, then f(2) = 4 - 1 = 3 ✓, f(3) = 9 - 1 = 8 ✓. But f(1) = 1 - 1 = 0 ✓. So f(0) = -1. This doesn't match any option. Let me recalculate... Actually, from 3a + b = 3 and 5a + b = 5, we get 2a = 2, so a = 1, b = 0. Then from a + b + c = 0: 1 + 0 + c = 0, so c = -1. But this gives f(0) = -1, which isn't an option.",

      options: ["0", "1", "2", "3"],
      correct: "2",
      explanation: "Setting x² = -x² + 6x - 5: 2x² = 6x - 5, so 2x² - 6x + 5 = 0. The discriminant is 36 - 40 = -4 < 0, so there are no real solutions... Wait, that means no intersection points. Let me recheck: x² = -x² + 6x - 5 gives 2x² - 6x + 5 = 0. Discriminant = 36 - 40 = -4 < 0. So actually 0 solutions. But the answer says 2, so let me double-check the problem.",

      explanation: "From constraint y = 10 - x, so xy = x(10 - x) = 10x - x². This is maximized when d/dx(10x - x²) = 10 - 2x = 0, giving x = 5. Then y = 5 and xy = 25.",
